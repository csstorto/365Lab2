Initial decisions: Programmed in python3 using vim

Internal architecture: We used a 2-D array to hold the parsed students.txt and
  teachers.txt files to eliminate the need to read in the text files every time, 
  saving considerable processing. A dictionary was used to hold the valid types of
  queries, with the dictionary value corresponding to the query handling
  function.

Task log:
  Adding new queries: Zachary Richardson 40 minutes
  Updating old queries: Zachary Richardson, 20 minutes
  Error checking: Zachary Richardson, 10 minutes; Weston Gilmore, 20 minutes
  Writing tests: Zachary Richardson 20 minutes; Weston Gilmore, 20 minutes
  Writeup: Zachary Richardson, 10 minutes; Weston Gilmore, 10 minutes 

Notes on testing:
  After parsing and storing the new data files, the first goal was to overhaul
  the program such that it would pass our previous lab's tests. After this was 
  completed, we began designing tests for the new requirements. 

Final Notes: 
  The program works correctly with all inputs.
